## Git, GitHub

### Q1 - URL of GitHub Repo

My URL for my GitHub Repo is https://github.com/amelia1209812/CS625_FALL25 . I used this repo to practice basic Git operations like adding files, committing, pushing, and pulling the different changes.

### Q2 - Pull Command

"git pull" send remote changes to the local machine. The "pull" command fetches updates from the remote repository and then merges them into the current local branch. It does not send changes to the server, that is what "git push" does.

### Q3 - Local Commits

I would have might forgotten to run "git push." When committing a change with "git commit," it only saves the update locally. To transfer the change to the GitHub repository, I will need to run "git push" so that it will show up on the GitHub desktop. 

## Markdown

### Q1 - Bulleted List

- Apples
- Bananas
- Grapes

A bulleted list is unordered which means the items do not have a specific sequence. A numbered list is ordered and further implies that the order or ranking of items is important such as steps in a process.

### Q2 - Markdown Paragraph

I was walking through the *interfimensional potato farm* when I stumbled upon a **talking llama** who whispered, "***Never trust a penguin with sunglasses***." Confused, I typed `llama.speak("Hello, traveler!")` into my reality debugger and suddenly a portal opened. If this sounds absurd, you're not alone; real more about these phenomena at the [Society for the Bizarre Agricultural Incidents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

### Q3 - Animal Image

![This is a picture of my German Shepherd mix, Nala. (She is the brown and black dog on the right)](mydog_nala.JPG) This image of my dog was uploaded to the same directory as my report file and is displayed using the MArkdown image syntax.
